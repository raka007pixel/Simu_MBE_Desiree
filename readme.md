# Merged Beams Experiments: Simulation of 3p
0. Simulation for merged atomic beams experiments at DESIREE.
1. you need basic level in python to use these python3 scripts.
2. necessary libraries: numpy, scipy, pandas and periodictable (https://pypi.org/project/periodictable/)
3. it is allowed to use and share these codes inside the DESIREE group, author has limited responsibility to maintain and upgrade these codes.


* MC Simulation of 3 neutral particles is still under early stage of development.
